Rulegen: Rules-based generator infrastructure
=============================================

Rulegen is a set of tools providing the means to create random generators
based on a metalanguage, along the lines of Augmented Backus–Naur Form
(ABNF), but with different syntax.

Two example generators are included. The first, Academia, generates random
academic fields, on the model of "evolutionary neuroscience", "biomechanical
engineering", "extragalactic radioastronomy", and the like. The other,
Technobabble, generates component names reminiscent of sci-fi shows.
