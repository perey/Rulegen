    The graph is to be represented as a mapping of nodes to lists of
    nodes, representing an arc from the key to each item in the list.
    This is the representation used in the essay "Python Patterns -
    Implementing Graphs" <https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/>.

    The sort algorithm is from Kahn (1962).

    Keyword arguments:
        graph -- The graph to be sorted.
        startnodes -- A set of known nodes with no incoming edges. If
            omitted, the graph is searched for these as the first step
            of the algorithm; thus, providing this information can save
            time if it is already known.
